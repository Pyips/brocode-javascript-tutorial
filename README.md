# Code From BroCode's JavaScript Tutorial

As I completed [BroCode's JS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihy0QziLDf0&list=PLZPZq0r_RZOO1zkgO4bIdfuLpizCeHYKv) I put the code in this repo.

I did this mainly to enforce my use of git, but I thought it might also be helpful to others following his tutorial.

Everything uploaded here was coded without AI and tested as of the date of the upload. For the most part the code is exactly as it is in the videos. Most of the time I saved any code to rewrote as a comment.
