# Code From BroCode's JavaScript Tutorial

As I completed BroCode's JS tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihy0QziLDf0&list=PLZPZq0r_RZOO1zkgO4bIdfuLpizCeHYKv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihy0QziLDf0&list=PLZPZq0r_RZOO1zkgO4bIdfuLpizCeHYKv) I put the code in this repo. 

I did this mainly to enforce my use of git, but also perhaps the code will be useful to someone following his tutorial who is having trouble. 

Everything uploaded here was coded without AI and tested as working as of the date of the upload. For the most part the code is exactly as it is in the videos.
